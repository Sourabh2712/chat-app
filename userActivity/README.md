## Task 2: User Activity Tracking API
Scenario:
You are developing a backend service that tracks user activity within an application. Every time a user
performs an action (such as logging in, uploading a file, or clicking a button), the frontend logs it by
sending a small payload to your server.
Your task is to build a simple REST API to store these activities and provide reporting endpoints.

# üìä User Activity Tracking API

This is a simple Node.js + Express backend service that tracks user activities such as login, click, and upload. It stores the data in MongoDB and provides reporting endpoints.
